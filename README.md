Rosefall is a Visual Studio Code theme made for all nighters. It uses darker colors so you are not flashbanged by your own IDE.

If you are in need of a smooth but dark theme similar to One Dark Pro this is what you need. Don't have any illusions i just forked One Dark Pro and tweaked some color. You can find the original theme here on [their Github](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro)
