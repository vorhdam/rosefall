Rosefall is a Visual Studio Code theme made for all nighters. It uses darker colors so you are not flashbanged by your own IDE.

If you are in need of a smooth but dark theme similar to One Dark Pro this is what you need. Don't have any illusions i just forked One Dark Pro and tweaked some color. You can find the original theme here on [their Github](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro)

### V2 is out with new themes:
- Rosefall gray: Similar to the darkest theme in One Dark Pro
- Rosefall black: The good old theme you used to know
- Rosefall midnight: A new extra dark theme for those who seek darkness
